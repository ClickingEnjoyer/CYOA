      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      
      <p>
        You wake up in a cold sweat. You pant as you recall the horrifying nightmare that you just had.
        Why did you have that dream just when you were starting your first day as a hunter? Surely it's
        just your anxiousness at work. You climb out of bed and look around your room. It's beginning to
        sink in that you really are a hunter now, as you look at the beginner weapons that have been provided
        to you by the Hunter Association. You pin on your hunter's badge after putting on your suit, as you begin to contemplate which
        weapons to bring.
       </p>
       
       <ul>
        <li>Sword and Shield Combo</li>
        <li> Long Spear </li>
       </ul>
       
       <p> Surely there must only be one option available. Safety is of paramount 
       on your first day as a hunter after all...</p>
